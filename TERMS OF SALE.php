                    by the restrictions as laid out in the Terms of Service, and should it come to the attention of
                    Grafix Wizard that you have violated the Terms of Service or this Terms of Sale, you agree that

                <h2>3) Color Matching</h2>
                <p>Grafix Wizard sells its products through an E-Commerce Web Site viewable by computers connected to the
                    Internet. These computers may view Grafix Wizards products solely through their computer screens
                    ("Monitors"). Monitors may be configured to display images and colors in a variety of ways, both
                    through the use of hardware setup and software setup. There are many possible settings for
                    Monitors and there is no true uniform standard to which all Monitors conform. What may look one
                    way on one monitor, will look different on another.</p>
                <p>Further, computer monitors display images with light and use a standard known as RGB to do so. Grafix
                    Wizard produces products in a variety of ways (CMYK, PMS, and others) that do not use light.</p>
                <p>As such, you agree that Grafix Wizard does not guarantee that the colors as they appear on the screen
                    will look the same as the colors as they appear on the purchased product. Grafix Wizard works hard
                    to make the colors on the screen be as true as possible to the printed colors, however, the
                    differences in Monitors and the differences between light and pigment make it impossible to
                    guarantee matching colors for all Users.</p>

                <h2>4) Materials</h2>
                <p>You agree that you have read our website and/or researched independently and that you know what each
                    of these materials is and what you are buying. Grafix Wizard only guarantees that you will receive
                    the materials advertised on the Web Site that you purchase. You agree that Grafix Wizard is not
                    responsible for products received that are made of materials thought by the purchaser to be
                    something other than advertised on the Web Site.</p>
                <p>As an example, you agree Grafix Wizar is not responsible if the cotton t-shirt received by the
                    purchaser is not what the purchaser envisioned a cotton t-shirt would be.</p>
                <p>You agree that all products produced and sold by Grafix Wizard are for novelty purposes only. Grafix
                    Wizard does not make any claims about the legal compliance or registration of any products sold by
                    Grafix Wizard or by a Grafix Wizard affiliate. You agree to check with any applicable legal
                    authority for the standards, rules and regulations governing the types of products permitted for
                    your particular use.</p>

                <h2>5) Uploaded Images</h2>
                <p>Grafix Wizard permits users to upload images onto their apparel and products through the Grafix
                    Wizard Web Site. You agree that Grafix Wizard is not responsible for the quality of the images you
                    upload. The Grafix Wizard Web Site attempts to make a "best guess" as to the best viewing distance
                    of your image based on the internally stored DPI (Dots Per Inch) contained in the image file. The
                    Web Site assumes that 100 DPI is best viewed from 3.5 feet and tries to make a best distance
                    estimate based on that assumption.</p>
                <p>You agree that you alone are responsible for making sure that the quality of the image you are
                    uploading is of high enough quality to be satisfactory to you at the size you select on the sign or
                    product that you are purchasing. Images are created and stored in a variety of ways and you agree
                    that Grafix Wizard is not responsible for ensuring quality images for any image file format
                    available on the Web Site.</p>

                <h2>6) Clip Art</h2>
                <p>Grafix Wizard offers a broad range of clip art available on the Web Site for use with your custom
                    shirts and products. You agree that this clip art is for novelty purposes only and are not meant
                    to be taken as official symbols, art or graphics. You also agree that with the exception of the
                    Realtor(R) clip art, none of the clip art has been approved through official organizations or
                    groups.</p>

                <h2>7) Production Time</h2>
                <p>Grafix Wizard works hard to ensure that orders will be produced and delivered to the customer within
                    10 business days of order. The date of order is the calendar date of order if the order is placed
                    before 5:00pm Pacific Standard Time and the next business day after the calendar date of order if
                    the order is placed between 5:01pm and 11:59pm Pacific Standard Time.</p>
                <p>This means that a purchase made at 3:00pm Monday, will be delivered by Monday two weeks after the
                    order. This production time is not guaranteed and is limited in many ways as discussed in the
                    Shipping Policy.</p>
                <p>You agree that Grafix Wizard will take at least 5 business days to produce your order and that it may
                    take longer than 5 business days as laid out in the Shipping Policy. The Shipping Policy is hereby
                    incorporated by reference. Moreover, you agree that our shipping time frame may depend on your
                    response time to our inquiries regarding your order.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>8) Return and Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>You agree that Grafix Wizard guarantees the products it sells are free from manufacturing defects and
                    as such will be good for 90 days after purchase of the product. If the product fails or breaks
                    due to a manufacturing defect during that time, you agree to take a photograph of the failed or
                    broken product and send the photograph or the original failed or broken product to Grafix Wizard.
                    Upon receipt of the product or the photograph, Grafix Wizard will send a replacement of the product
                    or will issue a refund via the original payment method for the purchase value of the failed or
                    broken product(s).</p>
                <p>Grafix Wizard does not guarantee or warrant that its products will work for any intended purpose or
                    in any set of conditions. You agree that the determination of whether a product's failure or
                    breakage is due to a manufacturing defect is within the sole discretion of Grafix Wizard. You
                    further agree to provide full and complete information regarding the circumstances of the failure
                    or breakage, including but not limited to the use of the product, the conditions the product was
                    in, and any other information useful to an informed determination by Grafix Wizard as to the cause
                    of the failure or breakage.</p>

                <h2>9) Changes to Your Order</h2>
                <p>Grafix Wizard provides many opportunities to review, revise and cancel the order process before actually placing your order. Grafix Wizard is able to offer its products at the present prices due to the efficiency of allowing the customer to create and modify their own products.
                </p>
                <p>You agree that Grafix Wizard is not responsible for reviewing, revising or canceling orders, products or images once an order has been placed. A Grafix Wizard employee, employer, officer, owner or authorized agent may revise or cancel an order but is not required or obligated to do so.
                </p>
                <p>You agree that you have reviewed your order and that no further additions, corrections or changes need to be made and that your order is final as is.

                <h2>10) Dispute Resolution/Waiver of Jury Trial.</h2>
                <p>All disputes arising out of, relating to or connected with these Terms of Sale or your use of any part of the Grafixwizard.com Service will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration held in Santa Barbara County, California before and in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, by a sole arbitrator applying California law (without regard for conflicts of law principles).
